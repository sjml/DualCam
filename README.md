![two cameras](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjml/DualCam/master/DualCam/Images.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/dualcams256.png)

the most basic "look at two webcams at once" implementation you could possibly imagine

* right-click to add a video source
* you can do it twice
	* once to the top and once to the bottom
* you can change the sources, too, I guess
* to reset, quit and relaunch
* to clear the video sources, quit and relaunch
* if the app is behaving weirdly, quit and relaunch

if you don't like the app, just quit
